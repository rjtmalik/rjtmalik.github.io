				 <h3>The House Of Cards - Sudha Murthy</h3>
                    <p>Mridula is the protagonist of the story. She was raised in Aladahalli, a small village near the towns of Hubli and Dharwad, in Karnataka. Her father, Bheemana, is a rich and respected man of Allahdali. We are then introduced to Sanjay, who is a talented but poor doctor. Sanjay worked in a government hospital of Mumbai. The couple fell in love and soon get married. After marriage, they shifted to Bangalore. Mridula became a teacher in a government school. They were leading a normal life until Sanjay decided to establish a private nursing home. Sanjay and Alex, his partner, started the Sushruta Nursing Home. Fourteen years had passed and Sushruta Nursing Home had now become one of the leading maternity homes in Bangalore. Sanjay had become more ambitious than ever before. He could turn any idea into a money making scheme. Sanjay was not the same person who Mridula had married. She didn’t like how Sanjay advices their son, Sishir. Mridula felt humiliated because Sanjay never donated any money to the poor. Whenever he donated money, he wanted his name to be associated with the charity. Mridula later discovered that Sanjay had been giving lots of money to his sister, Lakshmi. She realized how little she knows about Sanjay. She had lost faith in him. Mridula decided to leave Sanjay and went to Aladahalli. Sanjay and Sishir both realized Mridula’s selfless sacrifices. Sanjay was surprised. Their son, who had always hero worshipped him, had changed after being away from home. Two months passed by, Mridula never called Sanjay. Sanjay went to Aladahalli and saw Mridula swinging. Suddenly, Mridula realized that someone was trying to stop her swing. Surprised, she turned to look. Sanjay was holding the swing with his one good arm.</p>
