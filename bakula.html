				 <h3>Gently falls the Bakula - Sudha Murthy</h3>
                    <p>Shrikant and Shrimati had been classmates from the first standard and they had been neighbours for generations. A bitter rivalry exists between their families, from the times of their forefathers. It was the day the class tenth results were to be announced. Srikant studied hard but his mind went numb when he came to know that it is Shrimati who had secured first rank in the entire state. Srimati decided to study Arts and Shrikant went for science. Love blossomed between the two during their early morning visits near Bakula tree. When Shrikant went to IIT, he always wrote a letter to Shrimati. Shrimati never forgot to enclose a Bakula flower in her letters. Shrikant realized why flowers meant so much for him. The Bakula was now, for him, a symbol of Shrimati, a personification of her. Shrikant and Shrimati decided to marry each other. This came as a shock to Gangakka, Shrikant’s mother. Shrimati’s mother, Kamala, warned her that she will never be loved by Shrikant’s mother and sister. However, the couple shifted to Bombay after marriage. Shrikant climbed up the corporate ladder in a very short period.  Shrimati had to put her doctorate on hold due to the financial trouble caused by Gangakka.  Shrimati wanted to have children but her husband wanted to wait for some time. Shrimati was used to Gangakka’s frequent taunts. But, this time, Gangakka called her a barren woman. Shrimati remains in touch with Professor Collins. But her PhD. Dream is still distant. Shrimati had always been understanding, obedient and helpful to Shrikant. She believed that Shrikant was doing a great job and it was her duty to help him. Shrikant never recognized the sacrifices made by his wife. He became extremely busy at the office. Shrimati, in desperation, tried to get Shrikant to give her some time. Her mother Kamala’s words sprang up in her mind. When the topic of marriage was raised, her mother had said to her that her in-laws would never love her and Shrikant would never treat her better than his people. Now, Shrikant’s love had evaporated like water from a cup. Neglected b y her husband and in-laws, Shrimati took the toughest decision of her life. With the help of Professor Collins, Shrimati decided to do her PhD. In the U.S.A. The parting conversation between Shrikant and Shrimati is extremely emotional. Shrimati told him that once upon a time she loved him more than History. But, now, she doesn’t want to suffer such loneliness.  Shrikant realized how cruel he been to his wife over the past ten years. He wanted to stop his wife at the airport. But his enthusiasm disappeared like a bubble when he thought about it rationally. If he brought Shrimati home, could he be the same Shrikant he was ten years ago? That was impossible. Shrikant was incapable of living the kind of life Shrimati wanted. The world of business had changed him deeply.  Shrimati, who had walked with him side by side for ten years had now left him all alone.</p>
