				 <h3>Sins Of the Father - Jeffrey Archer</h3>
                    <p>Harry had assumed the identity of Tom Bradshaw without knowing the consequences. Harry now had to face charges for the crimes he never committed. Sefton Jelks represented Harry in the court. He saved Harry from the charge of murder but Harry was found guilty for deserting the navy. The judge sentenced Tom Bradshaw six years in jail.  In prison, Harry met Patrick Quinn from whom he learned prison trades. After hard work, Harry managed to work as prison librarian. In the prison he wrote a book ‘the diary of a convict’. Another prisoner, Max Lloyd, became Harry’s friend. When Max was released, he requested Harry to keep sending him the readings from his book as he enjoyed reading them. Max published the book in his own name. Back in England, the news about Harry’s death came as shock to everybody. Emma, Harry’s girlfriend, went to meet Masie. She saw a letter by Tom Bradshaw at the mantelpiece. She recognizes the handwriting and believes that Harry is still alive. Emma decides to go to New York and search for Harry. In New York, Emma read ‘The Diary of a Convict’ and recognized so many familiar phrases. She became sure that Harry is the author of this book. On the other side, Giles Barrington joined the army. He was captured by the Germans as prisoner of war. He successfully escaped from the Germany. He was awarded the military cross for his act of bravery.
Masie married Mr. Holocombe, Harry’s school teacher. Hugo began facing financial troubles. So, he decided to start an affair with Olga because she looked fairly rich. He fathered an illegitimate child with her. Hugo refused to accept the child and attacked Olga when she blackmailed him. In self-defense Olga killed Hugo. She later committed suicide and left the child alone.
Emma seeked help from her Great-aunt Phyllis in New York and her son Alistair,who is a lawyer. They helped her in tracking Harry’s position. Harry and Patrick were sent with the navy to fight the war. Harry was severly injured and Patrick was dead.when they drove over a German landmine. Harry was sent to Bristol where he reunited with his family. As Hugo was dead, the press was interested as to who will inherit the Barrington estate. Harry hoped that Giles will inherit the estate.  The book ends in a suspense as the Lord Chancellor announces that he would present his judgment as to who will receive the Barrington fortune the next morning.
