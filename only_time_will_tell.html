				 <h3>Only Time Will Tell - Jeffrey Archer</h3>
                    <p>The story is centered on Harry Clifton. He was born in Bristol, England. He was told that his father, Arthur Clifton, was killed in the war. His mother, Masie Clifton, knows that Arthur was not killed in the war. He thought no more in life than to work in docks just like his father and uncle, Stan. Harry had the gift of singing. Miss Monday, the choir mistress; Mr. Holcombe, his elementary school teacher; and Old Jack Tar, who lived in the railway carriage at the docks convinced Harry to go to St. Bede’s. So, he won a choral scholarship to St. Bede’s. At St. Bede’s Giles Barrington became Harry’s best friend. The best thing that came from this friendship was Harry’s introduction to Giles’ sister, Emma. Emma became the love of Harry’s life.  Giles Barrington is the son of, Hugo Barrington, who owns the shipping company where his father and uncle stan worked. Hugo and Stan knows what happened to Arthur Clifton and how he died. Hugo Barrington hated Harry from the start because Harry was his first biological son. He feared that Harry might raise claims of inheritance on the Barrington estate. Masie worked as a waitress at tilly’s tea shop. She faced many hardships in her life. 
After St. Bede’s, Harry went to Bristol Grammar School and then to Oxford to study English. Harry and Emma decided to marry each other. They would have got married at the church if their marriage was not objected by Old Jack Tar. Jack Tar told the chaplain that Hugo Barrington is the father of both these unfortunate children.
Britain was now at the brink of war against the Germans. Harry decided to leave Oxford immediately and become a private soldier to fight the war. Sir Walter, Emma’s grandfather, helped Harry to join the Devonian, a cargo ship before he joins a real battleship. In the Devonian, Harry met Captain Havens and Tom Bradshaw, an officer. The Devonian was on its way to Cuba when it was attacked by the Germans. Harry thought that he is going to die in the sea.
Everyone except Harry died in the sea. Harry was saved by an American boat. He decided to switch his identity with Tom Bradshaw, an American. Harry announced ‘I’m Tom Bradshaw’. The moment Harry reached New York he was arrested on the charge of first degree murder.
